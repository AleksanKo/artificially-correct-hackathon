Submission for Artificially Correct Hackathon 2021.

**Task: Identifying sentences susceptible to machine translation bias**

**Team: Aleksandra Konovalova, Lukas Felser, Laura KÃ¶nig**

The idea was to create solution that could be potentially language-independent. We tested several approaches:
- Logistic Regression (sklearn)
- NER and dependency trees (spacy)
- pretrained Word Embeddings (gensim, just a quick look)
