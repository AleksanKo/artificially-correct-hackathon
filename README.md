**Task: Identifying sentences susceptible to machine translation bias**

**Team: Aleksandra Konovalova (https://github.com/AleksanKo/), Lukas Felser (https://github.com/lukasfelser), Laura KÃ¶nig**

Machine Translation is not perfect, and it can make mistakes in translations. However, if we could identify sentences that are more susceptible to a bias, we could prevent some of them happening.

The idea was to create solution that could be potentially language-independent. We tested several approaches:
- Logistic Regression (sklearn) - Challenge_4.ipynb
- NER and dependency trees (spacy) - Named_Entity_Rec.ipynb
- pretrained Word Embeddings (gensim, just a quick look) - Challenge_4.ipynb
