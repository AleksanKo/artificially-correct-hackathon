**Task: Identifying sentences susceptible to machine translation bias**

**Team: Aleksandra Konovalova, Lukas Felser, Laura KÃ¶nig**

Machine Translation is not perfect, and it can make mistakes in translations. However, if we could identify sentences that are more susceptible to a bias, we could prevent some of them happening.

The idea was to create solution that could be potentially language-independent. We tested several approaches:
- Logistic Regression (sklearn)
- NER and dependency trees (spacy)
- pretrained Word Embeddings (gensim, just a quick look)
